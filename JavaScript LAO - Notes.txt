Course: JavaScript Loops, Arrays and Objects

Achievement: Simplify Repetitive Tasks with Loops
  Introducing Loops, Arrays and Objects
  What are Loops?
    if (BOOLEAN) {
      ACTION
    }

    function randomNumber(upper) {
      return Math.floor( Math.random() * upper ) + 1;
    }
    var counter = 0;
    while ( counter < 10 ) {
      var randNum = randomNumber(6);
      document.write(randNum + ' ');
      counter += 1;
    }
  A Closer Look at Loop Conditions
    endless loop: boolean is always true, loop always runs!
  Exiting Loops
    break;
    while
    do while
    for
  The Refactor Challenge
    DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
    Refactor: improving an existing program
    Use loops or define functions
  What is an Array?
    var shoppingList = [
      'eggs',
      'milk',
      'break'
    ];
  Accessing Items in an Array
    index starts at 0
  Using Array Indices
  Adding Data to Arrays
    [array name].push adds to end
    [array name].unshift adds to beginning
  Removing Items from Arrayws
    Pop takes off where push puts on
    Shift takes off where unshift puts on
  Using For Loops with Arrays
    'iterate' through an array
    length is the method to get the number of items in the array
    counter is the index: for(i=0; i<list.length; i+=1)
  Useful Array Methods
    .join : adds something in between every element and returns a single string!
    .concat : adds an array to the end of another array (original arrays are retained)
    .indexOf : returns index of an item!
  Two-Dimensional Arrays
    Thinking of the arrays that are items in the outer array as rows. The number of items in the outer array is the number of rows. The number of items in each item array is the number of columns for that row.
    outerArray[i][j] : i is the row, j is the column
