Achievement: Tracking Data Using Objects
  The Object Literal
    object-oriented programming language
    add properties to an object, sep by commas, and assigned with :
    curly braces for an object (this is the object literal)
    square for an array
    property: value,
  Accessing Object Properties
    person['name'] or person.name
    dot notation
    create or rewrite properties
    person.name = whatever;
    person.skills.length
    skill is the property
    length is a method
  Using 'for in' to Loop Through an Object's Properties
    for (var prop in student) {
      console.log(prop, ': ', student[prop]);
    }
    have to use bracket notation!
    can have whatever variable to call the properties: prop, key, thingie, whatever
    remember to initialize or declare it using var
  Mixing and Matching Arrays and Objects
    array of objects?
    change a 2d array to an array of objects, whose objects have properties
  JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
    websites exchange data using JSON
    the data is formatted like a JS object!
  The Build An Object Challenge, Part 1
  The Build An Object Challenge, Part 1 Solution
    var students = [];
    /*** inside the array ***/
    {
      name: '',
      track: '',
      achievements: '',
      points: ''
    },
  The Build an Object Challenge, Part 2
  The Build an Object Challenge, Part 2 Solution
    new program file *.js
    var message = '';
    var student;
    function print(message) {
      var outputDiv = document.getEletById('output');
      outputDiv.innerHTML = message;
    }
    for () {
    }
    print(message);
  The Student Record Search Challenge
  The Student Record Search Challenge Solution
    run through the for loop looking for a match between user input and a student name
    if the name matches the current record, then print. otherwise keep searching
