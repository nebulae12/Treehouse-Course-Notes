Course: CSS Layout Basics

Achievement: Getting Started with CSS Layout
	What to Expect
	CSS Reset with Normalize
		a stylesheet that levels the playing ground
	Creating a Layout Wrapper
		use body or create a div
	Why Vertical Margins Collapse
		bc if two collide uninterrupted, both collapse to the larger of the two
		horizontal margins do NOT collapse
	Centering Page Content and Creating a Full-width Header
		three divs: header container or not, main content container, footer maybe no container
		to replace a wrapper div that contains the whole body
	Using a Mobile First Approach
		use @media query to deal with wider and wider screens
		box-size
	Creating a Sticky Footer
		footer sticks to bottom no matter how little content is on the page

Achievement: Controlling Layout with CSS Display Modes
	Positioning Elements Side-By-Side with Inline Display
		padding only affects horizontal space of inline elements
		use inline-block as the display value to get block element styling while keeping elements horizontally next to each other.
	Removing Gaps Between Inline and Inline-Block Elements
		negative margin values!
	The Column Layout Challenge & Solution
		vertical-align: top

Achievement: Page Layout with the Float Property
	How Floats Work
	Wrapping Text Around Images with Floats
	Creating a Horizontal Navigation with Floats
	Clearing and Containing Floats
		overflow: hidden; is an ok fix
		creating a clearfix is preferred
	The Float Challenge & Solution

Achievement: CSS Layout Project
	Introducing the Project
	Creating and Styling the Layout Containers
	Adding Media Queries for Large Screens
	Column Layout with Media Queries

Achievement: Positioning Page Content
	How Absolute Positioning Works
		elts unaffected by and do not affect more elts on the page!
		can determine where exactly on the page you want them... relative to the first parent elt that has position: relative;
	Positioning Elements Relative to Each Other
		position: relative;
		that elt becomes the origin for child elts whose positions are absolute
	Create an Image Caption with Absolute Positioning
		make the parent <figure> elt have position: relative;
		then for a caption on top do .figcaption bottom: 0; width: 100%;
		for an icon in the left top corner do
		.locationicon {width: 35px; position: absolute; top: -15px; left: -15px; }
	Fixed Positioning
		stays constant relative to the BROWSER WINDOW
		like a nav bar that doesn't disappear when you scroll on the page
		a strange phenom: any elt with absolute positioning appears on TOP of fixed position elts!
	How Z-index Works
		stacking works: things later in the source code appear on top of things earlier
		z-index is the "height" or stacking order. Larger means "higher" or stacked on top.
		Make the fixed header have a super high z-index to make it the top of the stack always.
