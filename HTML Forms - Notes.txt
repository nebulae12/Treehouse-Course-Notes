	Fieldsets and Legends
		fieldset to group certain inputs together
		legend to create a header for the fieldset inputs - goes inside the fieldset tags

Achievement: Choosing Options
	Select Menus
		allow user to select options rather than write in an input (replaces input element)
		option elements like li elements of an unordered list
	Radio Buttons
		preferable when options are few and want to see them all at once rather than in a dropdown
		input element uses radio type
		label associated with each radio "button"
		overall label element has nothing to associate with, so no for
	Checkboxes
		input type="checkbox"
		put label for the checkbox AFTER the input
	Going further
		Style the form elements, or make the form actually submit to something!
