Course: CSS Basics

Achievement: Getting Started with CSS
	CSS Basics Overview
	Introduction to CSS
		3 layers: content, presentation, behavior (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
		CSS now does things that only graphics editors used to do!
	CSS Resources
		mdn docs (mozilla developer network)
		webplatform docs (docs.webplatform.org)
		w3c (www consortium)
		caniuse.com (browser support)
	Intro to CSS Review
		3 ways to do author styles: inline, internal style sheet, external style sheet
	Inline and Internal Styles
		inline: css attributes (style) added to html tags
		internal style: css right inside the head section using <style>
	External Style Sheets
		<link rel="" href=""></link>
		@import "css/import-styles.css"
		keep @import statement in the beginning, of either the head section or the linked stylesheet

Achievement: Basic Selectors
	Intro to Selectors
		flow: rule, selector, declaration block, declaration, property, value
		universal selector *
	Type Selectors
		also called element selector
		HTML tag
	ID Selectors
		#[id here]
		have to assign id to HTML elements.
		id names are made up!
		eg: #top, next section, previous section.
	Class Selectors
		.[class here]
		class attributes - more than one element, where id's are attached to one element only.
		multiple elements share one class attribute!
	Reusing Classes
		elements can have multiple classes
		classes can be attached to multiple elements
		helps with writing less CSS code
		want to make sure elements in different id's or classes don't share the same properties
	Descendant Selectors
		nested elements are descendents
		selector is elements in order with spaces in between
	Pseudo-Classes
		[selector]:[pseudo-class]
		eg: (not only for links a:!) :hover, :visited, :active, :focus
	CSS Comments
		/*  */
	Basic Selectors Review


Achievement: Understanding Values and Units
	Common Data Types
		MDN - CSS Data Types
	Pixel Units
		MDN - <length>
		relative vs absolute
		6 absolute units: px, mm, cm, in, pt, pc
	Percentages
		relative to standard width of container or font, etc
	Em Units
		is a relative unit.
		Calculated based on parent element's font size.
	Rem Units
		is a relative unit.
		"root"-em
		root font size of a page, not the parent element.
		compounding doesn't happen; if parent element font size changed, no effect on child element font size.
	Colors Values
		MDN: <color>
	Text Styles
		text-transform (uppercase, etc)
		text-decoration (underline, etc)
		font-weight (bold, etc)
	Font Properties
		font-family (sans/serif, Verdana, etc)
		font stacks! (cycle through until find a font that is installed)
		cssfontstack.com
		font-style (normal, oblique, etc)
	Line Height
		line-height (unitless numbers, units, percentages, r/em units)
		font: style size family;
	Fonts and Line Height Review


Achievement: The Box Model
	The CSS Box Model
		block and inline elements
		box 4 parts: content, padding (inside box), border, margin (outside box)
	Padding
		-top, -right, -bottom, -left
		or just padding: all;
		padding: topbottom leftright;
		padding: top right bottom left;
		padding: % of width (not height)
	Borders
		border-width
		border-style
		border-color
		if 2 values, topbottom leftright
		if 4 values, top right bottom left
		border: width style color;
		can do all same borders except for one
		can do just one
		if no color specified, text color applies
	Margins
		auto: equal margins all around that centers the element.
	Challenge: Padding, Borders, Margins
	Display Values
		display (none, block, inline, inline-block)
		inline-block: flows like inline elements, styled like block elements (margins, etc)
	The Box Model Review


Achievement: Basic Layout
	Width and Height Properties
		can we define width and height of box, not just of content?
	box-sizing and max-width
		yes we can. this is one thing we can use the universal selector * for.
		box-sizing: border-box
		prevent boxes or images from being too wide: max-width
	Backgrounds: Color and Images
		properties: 
		bg img uses url function
		bg sz 
		bg repeat default repeats img x and y can specify either or no-repeat
	Backgrounds: Size and Position
		properties: background-
		color
		image
		repeat
		position
	Floats
		taken out of normal flow of page and floated to one side of its container
		collapses the height of the floated element in the parent element
	Clearing Floats
		overflow, good for a quick fix and simple layouts
		reliable method: clearfix
			.group:after {
				display: table;
				clear: both
			}
		clear
 		:after
	Lists
		ol, ul, li elements
		border, list-style-position (outside or inside), list-style-type, padding-left, margin-left properties


Achievement: Designing with the Latest Features
	Text Shadows
		text-shadow: x y blur color;
		x and y can be negative (+ is left bottom)
		3-d effect using multiple shaddows!
	Box Shadows
		box-shadow: inset x y blur color;
	Border Radius
		border-radius: topleft topright bottomright bottomleft;
		border-radius: topleft_bottomright topright_bottomleft;
		percents can create elliptical edges!
	Gradients
		bg img: linear-gradient(to direction or deg, color3, color2) (default direction vertical top to bottom, deg is from bottom ccw)
		bg img: radial-gradient(circle at somewhere, color1, color2) (color1 is center of circle)
	Gradients: Color Stops
		percent tells the position that pure color will show up
	Transparent Gradients and Multiple Backgrounds
		transparent as a color stop
		first is topmost layer
	Web Fonts with @font-face
		@font-face {
			font-family: 'Abolition Regular';
			src: ...
			...
		}
		.eot Embedded OpenType (IE)
		.woff Web Open Font Face (by Mozilla for all modern browsers)
		.ttf TrueType Format (Safari, Android, iOS)
		letter-spacing
	Media Queries
		@media (all OR boolean like max-width: 960px to check viewport of device) {
			
		}
	Adjusting Layout with Media Queries
		for smaller or narrower screens: reduce padding or margins, reduce font size, change multiple columns or floats to one column or no float
		in .html:
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">


Achievement: Fundamental Concepts
	The Cascade: Importance
		importance, specificity, source order
		importance: what file is it from?
		least to most: user agent, user, imported, author
	The Cascade: Specificity and Source Order
		least to most specific: class, id, element, inline
		source order least to most: typed first to last
	Inheritance
		child elements inherit traits of parents
		use 'initial' to override inheritance
	Learning Tips and Tools
		workspaces, CodePen.io
		ask people!
